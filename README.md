Followed along with the code in class.
Hit s to see the debug log to show that it works.

The dll and the dll metafile (I'm not sure if you need the metafile) go into plugins.
The .cs file and the .cs metafile go into _Scripts (again, not sure you need the metafile).

This should work in any blank Unity project.
